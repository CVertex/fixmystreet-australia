This is an XCode Project for an iPhone 'FixMyStreet' client application.

Anyone is free to copy the source code for this application and to do what s/he wants with it. It is provided 'as is'
without any kind of warranty or guarantee. Coder, be ware ;-)

This iPhone application has been written to allow users to report problems in their local environment to a 'FixMyStreet'
style web application. It has been developed with the intention of using it to report problems to an Australian
'FixMyStreet' style application, but has been written to use the same 'problem report protocol' as used by MySociety's
'FixMyStreet' at http://www.FixMyStreet.com so other people may wish modify this application for use with their
web site.
